Bottle Can or Coffee Cup

How Computer Vision and Machine Learning can be used to Recognise Different Materials to Make Recycling Easier

This project has been developed by the Materials Made Smarter Centre at Swansea University in collaboration with the Sustain Manufacturing Research Hub and Discover Materials to demonstrate how Computer Vision and Machine Learning can be used to recognise different objects to help with the sorting of materials for recycling.

The platform this project is built on is the Seeed Studio reComputer J1010 NVIDIA Jetson Nano 2GB Platform with the Arm Cortex A57 CPU and NVIDIA Maxwell GPU and it has been developed by Dr R. Gibbs and Prof. C. Giannetti based upon the NVIDIA DLI "Getting Started with AI on Jetson Nano‚Äù course.

This github arxive contains the technical files and documents used to develop the project

The documentation supporting the demonstration of this project to ages 11+ is provided on the website

Professor C. Giannetti would like to acknowledge the support of the EPSRC (EP/V061798/1) in this Materials Made Smarter Project.
