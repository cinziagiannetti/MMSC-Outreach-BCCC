This project has been developed by the Materials Made Smarter Centre at Swansea University in collaboration with the Sustain Manufacturing Research Hub and Discover Materials to demonstrate how Computer Vision and Machine Learning can be used to recognise different objects to help with the sorting of materials for recycling.

The documentation supporting the demonstration of this project to ages 11+ is provided on the website

https://discovermaterials.co.uk/resource/bottle-can-or-coffee-cup/

at original development the demonstration of the project at events included an A0 poster and 500+ A5 booklets

The poster file in github repository is at 300dpi. A 600dpi version is in the associated zenodo repository.
