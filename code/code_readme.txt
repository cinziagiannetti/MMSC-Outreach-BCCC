Bottle Can or Coffee Cup

How Computer Vision and Machine Learning can be used to Recognise Different Materials to Make Recycling Easier

This project has been developed by the Materials Made Smarter Centre at Swansea University in collaboration with the Sustain Manufacturing Research Hub and Discover Materials to demonstrate how Computer Vision and Machine Learning can be used to recognise different objects to help with the sorting of materials for recycling.

The platform this project is built on is the Seeed Studio reComputer J1010 NVIDIA Jetson Nano 2GB Platform with the Arm Cortex A57 CPU and NVIDIA Maxwell GPU and it has been developed by Dr R. Gibbs and Prof. C. Giannetti based upon the NVIDIA DLI "Getting Started with AI on Jetson Nano‚Äù course.

The documentation supporting the demonstration of this project to ages 11+ is provided on the website

https://discovermaterials.co.uk/resource/bottle-can-or-coffee-cup/

The main code for the project is the jupyter interactive python notebook

MMSC_BCCC.ipynb

the code is available in this folder, can be opened with jupyter notebook and is self-documented.

https://jupyter.org/

a full walkthrough of the code is available at
https://discovermaterials.co.uk/app/uploads/2025/02/03-Investigation-of-the-Code_Guide.pdf

in the 
./website_guides_and_resources/ 
folder of this github repository

and a video walkthrough on the Discover Materials website at
https://discovermaterials.co.uk/resource/03-machine-learning-and-neural-networks/

and at the youtube playlist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgNSorR79xs&list=PLyl3ubsSP6pUkBdTephBtqL7UfIFfGQ_Z&index=3

datasets of the iamges are available in 

/images/
/BCCCrestore/images/
/alternative_versions/discover_materials/images/

on github

or the 7z arxives on zenodo

the saved trained models
BCCC_A_model.pth
BCCC_B_model.pth
WWGC_model.pth

are 43MB and too large for the github repository and so can be found in the associated zenodo repository
 
Professor C. Giannetti would like to acknowledge the support of the EPSRC (EP/V061798/1) in this Materials Made Smarter Project.
