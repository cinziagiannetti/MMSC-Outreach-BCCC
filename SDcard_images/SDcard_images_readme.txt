Bottle Can or Coffee Cup

This project has been developed by the Materials Made Smarter Centre at Swansea University in collaboration with the Sustain Manufacturing Research Hub and Discover Materials to demonstrate how Computer Vision and Machine Learning can be used to recognise different objects to help with the sorting of materials for recycling.

The platform this project is built on is two Seeed Studio reComputer J1010 NVIDIA Jetson Nano 2GB Platforms.

The first unit, reComputer1, with username jetson1 provides the machine learning environment.
The second unit, reComputer2, with username jetson2 drives the HDMI monitor providing the Ubuntu 18 jupyter notebook graphical interface.

Each system is hosted from a 64GB SD card.

The compressed .img image files of each of the SD cards are provided in this folder, to guard against damage to either of the SD cards.

reComputer1_SD.img approx. 64 GB
reComputer2_SD.img approx. 64 GB

The files are compressed using 7zip, downloadable from https://www.7-zip.org/

reComputer1_SD.7z approx. 7.2 GB
reComputer2_SD.7z approx. 7.6 GB

due to the size of these files they are stored in the attached zenodo repository only, the DOI for the zenodo repository is found in the file
~/zenodo_DOI_for_large_7z_files.txt

Each compressed file is approx. 8GB in size and will expand to approx 64GB

Once expanded the required SD image can be flashed to a new SD card using balenaEtcher https://etcher.balena.io/

The SD card must be at least 64GB but can be larger.

The documentation supporting the demonstration of this project to ages 11+ is provided on the website

Professor C. Giannetti would like to acknowledge the support of the EPSRC (EP/V061798/1) in this Materials Made Smarter Project.
